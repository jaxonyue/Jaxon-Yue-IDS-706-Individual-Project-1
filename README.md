This repository includes the components for Mini-Project 2 - Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script. It uses my Python template and contains a series of EDA on a dataset related to the development of average annual wages across various countries in the world. The EDA process includes getting essential statistics such as mean and median, as well as a quick data visualization on the growth of the average annual wages. This repo also contains a few tests to check whether the statistics calculated in the EDA process match with the real data.

### Key elements in the repository are:
* Development of average annual wages.csv
* Makefile
* requirements.txt
* Dockerfile
* devcontainer
* main.py
